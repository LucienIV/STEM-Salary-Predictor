For the schema I had to remove the otherdetails column from the dataset to import into the database. It containing mostly ancilary and unrelated data, making it completely useless for our machine learning project. Additionally, the headers for the timestamp, level, and location needed to be changed as they were reserved names in PostGres. The rowNumber value was used as the primary key.
