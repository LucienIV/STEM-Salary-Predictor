# Capstone-Project
Group project at end of boot camp
Martha, Lucien and Cheryl

### GitHub:
•	Your Main Branch has a ReadMe file
•	Your ReadMe file includes a description for how your team plans to communicate for the project (Ex. Utilize Slack, when you might meet, etc.)
•	You have individual branches setup for each of your team members
•	Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment

### Presentation:
•	Include your choice of a PowerPoint, Word Document, ReadMe file, etc. with the following information:
•	Your selected topic

### Topic: 
Data Science and STEM Salaries from June 7 2017 to Aug 17 2021
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries

•	Description of your data source (feel free to include a sample of it too)
[Insert image of abbreviated datatable]

•	Reasons for your selected topic

### Reason: 
We found the data source relevant to our current career interests.  In addition,the dataset was appropriately dimensioned and did not have a lot of missing data.  Datatypes varied across the columns and there are several features that can be used to for modeling.  

•	Questions you hope to answer with this data
### Question: 

- What features does this data contain and how many rows of data are included?  How many years? How many professions? Employers?
- What are the average salaries for each profession?  Is there any relationship between the annual base salary and the complete compensation package? 
- Is there a difference in average salaries by employer? By gender? By location? Years of experience?  Are these differences significant?
- What features should be used to predict the annual and/or complete compensation when linear regression is applied?  
- We would like to predict the annual base salary and/or complete compensation for new hires based on input of the applicable features? 
- What features can be used to give a model that predicts accuracy to at least 75% with an ultimate goal of 90% for the final model?

### Database
•	Present a provisional database that stands in for the final database
•	This can be a description of sample data and the database structure that you plan on having for your project
•	Include plans for how the Machine Learning model might connect with this database
•	(This information can be included in the ReadMe file)

### Machine Learning Model
•	Present a provisional machine learning model
•	This can be a description of what Machine Learning model you would like to use based on a past Machine Learning example from class or one of the activities
•	Include plans for how it would take in the data from your provisional database (which language to bring it in ie. from PgAdmin)
•	(This information can be included in the ReadMe file)
