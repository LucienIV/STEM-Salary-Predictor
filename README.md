## Reason: 
We found the data source relevant to our current career interests.  In addition,the dataset was appropriately dimensioned and did not have a lot of missing data.  Datatypes varied across the columns and there are several features that can be used to for modeling.  

## Questions: 
- Is there a difference in average salaries by employer? By gender? By location? Years of experience?
- We would like to predict the annual base salary and/or complete compensation for new hires based on input of the applicable features.
